                 <p class="lead">Considering that the 311 number is a service provided by the City of Boston to make inquiries and non-urgent concerns, the types and numbers of complaints can be a good representation of how a neighborhood is or what types of problems might appear there. But one can go further and try to see if all calls are treated in the same way, or if it takes the same amount of time to close a case in one place or another and re-do the question to "are all neighborhoods in Boston treated equally?".</p>
